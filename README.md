*What size should I get for these sneakers?*

Have you ever wanted to know the right size for sneakers you want to purchase online without even trying them on? Kicksize can help.

I created Kicksize to tackle this challenge of predicting the right sneaker size using the large set of user data. As a user, you enter three pieces of information: weight, height, and different sneakers you own with their sizes. Then, using a regression analysis library and a scoring algorithm, this web application attempts to calculate the size to suggest to the user. I am also using data visualization library React-D3 to display different sets of data used for the calculation.

## Motivation

I always have been a big fan of sneakers since I was a kid. As a true sneakers fan, I enjoy collecting rare sneakers that are often only available from online. A struggle I face most oftenly from purchasing these rare sneakers is that I simply don't know which sizes to get. Not only do different sneakers brands use unique measurements, different models for the same brand also vary in measurements and shapes for the size. I have always wished there was a tool that could tell me the right size for sneakers without even trying them on. With my background in Math and Programming, I tackled this challenge.
